**Neurobiology Laboratory**

**Instructor: Robin Ball**

The goal of this module is to provide two 30-minute data science explorations using data from the Allen Brain Atlas API to supplement the 3 hour Lab on Mouse Brain Connectivity. Students will first be introduced to the world of Jupyter Notebooks, Python and statistical analysis (bootstrapping & hypothesis testing). In the first 30 minute exploration, we quantify projection densities between the Subiculum and other brain structures to conduct a hypothesis test on whether a given projection belongs to those of the Primary Visual Area. In the latter exploration, we learn how to calculate and graph gene expression densities across various regions of the brain; students will explore and analyze a gene and brain region of their choosing using skills acquired in this module.
